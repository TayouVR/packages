# tweaks-applied Branch
### This branch adds a few QOL tweaks, which are all in pull requests on the main repo too.
In addition this branch disables all kinds of error based upload/build blocking. This could be refined to only disabled certain things, but i am too lazy to do so.
In a nutshell the SDK blocks uploading for too many things, e.g. blend shape normals, so I am just disabling the upload blocking alltogether.
